# Week 5 Exercise: Connect 4 in Python

## The Quest
This week exercise is to build a fully functional connect 4 game (rules can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four#:~:text=The%20two%20players%20then%20alternate,the%20game%20is%20a%20draw.), or if you want a [test play](https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/connect4.html)).

You can create a terminal interface to play the game, players can play using the ```input()``` function. Here's an example from our PD Sam:

## Example structure
There's a few classes in ```example.py``` that may give you some idea of how to start. It's only a suggestion, so feel free to make lots of changes and do it however you like. Be creative!

## Ideas to explore
For additional add up to the project:
- 3-player Connect 4 game (or more) 
- Create a bot player that plays a random move
- Graphical Interface (This may take more than a weekend to finish, but feel free to explore), you can use [graphics.py](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15886455/simple-graphics-for-python?answertab=votes#tab-top) or maybe [turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#:~:text=Turtle%20graphics%20is%20a%20popular%20way%20for%20introducing%20programming%20to%20kids.&text=The%20turtle%20module%20is%20an,)%20100%25%20compatible%20with%20it.)
